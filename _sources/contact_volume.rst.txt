Due to their conjugated :math:`\pi`-system fluorophore often interact with the biomolecule. Such surface stacking changes the mean position of the dye in the accessible volume. The fluorophore no longer rotates isotropically but displays an anisotropic distribution around the biomolecule. To account for the fraction of dyes that are sticking to the biomolecule we introduced the **contact volume** (CV) as an extension of the accessible volume.[1] The **width** and **weight** of the CV are two additional parameters that go into the ACV calculations. The width is usually set to match one of the dye dimensions while the weight attributed to each point in the CV is estimated from fluorescence anisotropy decays.
